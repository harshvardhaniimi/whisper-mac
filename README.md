2. **Speak** - Say what you want to transcribe
3. **Stop & transcribe** - Press Cmd+Shift+Space again
4. **Done!** - Text appears at your cursor and is copied to clipboard

**Example:** Writing an email? Click in the email body, press Cmd+Shift+Space, speak your message, press Cmd+Shift+Space again. The transcribed text appears in your email!

### Using the Menu Bar App

1. **Click the menu bar icon**
2. **Click "Record"** and speak
3. **Click "Stop Recording"** when done
4. **Copy to clipboard** to use the text elsewhere

## Model Selection Guide

| Model  | Size   | Speed  | Accuracy | Best For                    |
|--------|--------|--------|----------|-----------------------------|
| Tiny   | 75 MB  | ⚡⚡⚡⚡  | ⭐⭐     | Quick notes, older hardware |
| Base   | 142 MB | ⚡⚡⚡   | ⭐⭐⭐    | General use (recommended)   |
| Small  | 466 MB | ⚡⚡    | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   | Better accuracy             |
| Medium | 1.5 GB | ⚡     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  | High accuracy, good hardware|
| Large  | 2.9 GB | ⚡     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Best accuracy, powerful Macs|

**Recommendation:**
- **M1/M2/M3 Macs**: Start with Base or Small
- **Intel Macs**: Start with Tiny or Base
- **Quick notes**: Tiny or Base
- **Important transcriptions**: Small or Medium

## System Requirements

- **macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later**
- **RAM:**
  - 8 GB minimum (for tiny/base models)
  - 16 GB recommended (for small/medium models)
  - 32 GB for large model
- **Storage:** 100 MB - 3 GB per model
- **Microphone** (for recording)

**Performance Notes:**
- Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) provides ~10x better performance than Intel
- Base model on M1: ~6 seconds to transcribe 1 minute of audio
- Real-time transcription possible on Apple Silicon with small models

## Privacy

🔒 **Your privacy is paramount:**

- ✅ All processing happens locally on your Mac
- ✅ No internet connection required (except for model downloads)
- ✅ No data collection or telemetry
- ✅ No cloud services or external APIs
- ✅ Audio never leaves your device
- ✅ Transcription history stored locally only
- ✅ You have full control over all data

Models are downloaded once from Hugging Face and stored locally:
```
~/Library/Application Support/WhisperMac/models/
```

## Technical Details

**Architecture:**
- **Language**: Swift 5.9+
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Audio**: AVFoundation
- **ML Backend**: whisper.cpp (optimized C++ implementation)
- **Acceleration**: Metal + Accelerate frameworks

**Design Philosophy:**
- Native macOS design patterns
- Retro-inspired but modern aesthetic
- Clean, minimal interface
- Keyboard-first workflow
- Subtle, purposeful animations

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Cmd+Shift+Space** (anywhere in macOS) - Start/stop recording with auto-insert at cursor
- `⌘+C` - Copy transcription
- `⌘+,` - Settings (coming soon)
- `⌘+H` - Show history (coming soon)

### Global Hotkey

The global hotkey (Cmd+Shift+Space) works out of the box - **no Accessibility permissions required** for the hotkey itself!

You can:
- Record from any application
- Have text automatically inserted at your cursor
- Text is also copied to clipboard as backup

**Note:** Text insertion at cursor still requires Accessibility permissions.

## Troubleshooting

**App doesn't appear in menu bar:**
- Check that `LSUIElement` is set in Info.plist
- Restart the app

**Global hotkey (Cmd+Shift+Space) not working:**
- Make sure the hotkey is enabled in Settings
- Check if another app is using the same hotkey (e.g., Spotlight, another app)
- Restart the app

**Text not inserting at cursor:**
- Enable Accessibility permissions (see above)
- The text is always copied to clipboard as a backup - use Cmd+V to paste
- Make sure you're focused in a text input field

**Microphone not working:**
- System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone
- Enable permission for WhisperMac

**Model didn't auto-download on first launch:**
- Check internet connection
- Go to Settings and manually download the base model
- Check ~/Library/Application Support/WhisperMac/models/

**Poor transcription quality:**
- Try a larger model (small or medium)
- Ensure good audio quality (clear voice, minimal background noise)
- Check microphone input levels
- Speak clearly and avoid background noise

**Slow performance:**
- Use a smaller model (tiny or base)
- Close resource-intensive apps
- Check Activity Monitor for CPU/RAM usage

**Model download fails:**
- Check internet connection
- Try again (downloads can be large)
- Manually download from Hugging Face if needed

## Uninstall

To completely remove WhisperMac and all its data:

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harshvardhaniimi/whisper-mac/main/uninstall.sh | bash
```
